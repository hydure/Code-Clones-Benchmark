These are likely the best attributes that we will be able to parameterize for a later sprint. 

Similarity - Represented by 0.95 or 1.0 in the file names in this case. Essentially a
		   	 threshold for how similar you want the clones to be.

Min Tokens - Represented by the 30 or 50 in the file names in this case.
		   	 Used to avoid reporting small clones.

Stride	   - Represented by the second integer (0 or 2 in this case) in the file name
		   	 "Users can choose the width of the sliding window and how far it moves in each step.
		   	 (i.e. stride) Larger widths allow larger code fragments to be encoded together, and
			 may help detect larger clones, while larger strides reduce the amount of overlapping
			 among tree fragments and may reduce the number of spurious clones."

The "easiest" one of these to read is the sample-clone-report_100_0_allg_1.0_50.
